<p>Indigenous Water Protectors fighting Line 3 in Minnesota have put out a call:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Show up to support the front lines. 
Hear <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Pmy7nYXkEUU?t=1211">Tara Houska </a> and <a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/Pmy7nYXkEUU?t=1030" blank="_target">Taysha Martineau</a> put out the call.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the moment:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enbridge is close to crossing the 22 waterways that Water Protectors are trying to protect.
    <ul>
      <li>Enbridge is devastating the Water Protectorsâ€™ wild rice wetlands and forests around there in the process.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At the end of March, Enbridge must renew $2.2 billion in loans from 18 banks, and we want to stop that money pipeline.</li>
  <li>With thousands of out-of-state workers, the man camps are a threat to Indigenous women as well as a huge Covid hazard.</li>
  <li>If constructed, Enbridgeâ€™s tar sands pipeline would produce as many emissions as 50 coal power plants, exacerbating the climate emergency.
    <ul>
      <li><em>Given the momentum from the KXL cancellation, we need to push the Biden administration to cancel Line 3 and DAPL as well.</em></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><strong>The time is now!</strong></p>
