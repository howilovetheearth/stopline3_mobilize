  <li>We encourage every locality to do a socially-distanced replicable action in front of <em>at least</em> one of the key banks considering loan
renewals (such as Chase or Bank of America). Check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1sKHQbosd7eWe4T3M4uozmaqSvAuczWeY6xX5NVfceEk/edit#" target="_blank">for some ideas</a>.</li>

<h3 id="local-in-person-action-ideas">Local In-person Action Ideas</h3>

<p>Here are some concrete ideas to help you plan. Reach out to Indigenous leaders and drummers for
leadership in planning and implementation:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Make colorful banners with clear messaging “Defund Line 3 or We Divest! Stop Line 3!”</li>
  <li>Think of visuals that will make a powerful impact (such as setting up silhouettes of 50 coal fired
 power plants, the daily carbon equivalent of the 844K barrels of tar sands oil coming through
 Line 3 and being sent for export). Get creative and brainstorm. Make it beautiful and eye-catching! Chalk clear messages with facts about Line 3 and relating tar sands and climate chaos.</li>
  <li>Create street theatre about Line 3 (how about a parody on Indigenous lands being invaded
 without their consent by having folks dressed up as construction workers (hard hats,
 clipboards, huge black pipes) coming in and starting to lay down pipe in front of their doors or in
 their lobby while saying “Yep, we’ve got a work order here…What? You didn’t ask for this?
 Hmmmmm…well we’ve got our orders and must get it installed as soon as possible…”. How
 about a skit with a black molasses oil spill in front of their door and focus on Enbridge’s
 wretched record of over 73 oil spills in 10 years including the 1 million barrel spill into the
 Kalamazoo river that cost $1.2 billion to clean up… This pipeline is going under 227 waterways
 including the headwaters of the Mississippi and across 800 wetlands and is a disaster waiting to
 happen. Talk about how heavy tar sands oil sinks and would be almost impossible to clean up
 as you are “cleaning up” the molasses spill.</li>
  <li>Hand out leaflets explaining to customers why they should put pressure on their bank and why
 they should consider divesting if the banks don’t stop funding Line 3 (and other fossil fuel
 projects).</li>
  <li>Check to see if you have any local connections to folks on the Board of Enbridge or the Banks
 doing the loan renewals and if so, then target their offices or homes with the Stop Line 3 and
 Defund Line 3 messages.</li>
  <li>One you’ve come up with a replicable action, repeat it at other banks or bank branches!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="write-to-gina-mccarthy">Write to Gina McCarthy</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Write to Gina McCarthy, White House National Climate Advisor. Tell her they must put a stop to Line 3 and DAPL as soon as possible and at the latest by Earth Day before they dig under the waterways and destroy the wetlands.
Mail to the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW  Washington DC 20500 and tweet her at @Gina_McCarthy!</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="boycott-and-divest">Boycott and Divest</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Go online to Chase, Citi, Bank of America and others of the 18 lending banks  websites and post bad reviews telling folks what they are doing by funding Line 3 and asking customers to put pressure on these 18 banks to not renew the $2 billion credit facility renewal to Enbridge end of March.  If they don’t defund, we must divest.  If you have an account at one of these banks, move it to a community bank or credit union and tell them you will divest if they renew the loans and then follow through.  Wells Fargo, Citibank, and 64 other banks support these projects. See <a href="https://mazaskatalks.org/#theboycott" target="_blank"> this page</a> for more.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-ideas">Other Ideas</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Send out a press release, follow up with calls to the media, keep pestering them to turn out and
cover the event. Get on community radio and public radio talk shows and calendars.</li>
  <li>Make your own social media and be sure to send photos of your actions to the Banks
themselves and to Gina McCarthy, the new White House Climate Policy Advisor.</li>
  <li>Highlight, link with, livestream, and publicize actions going on in Minnesota and make the
connections to these local actions.</li>
</ul>
