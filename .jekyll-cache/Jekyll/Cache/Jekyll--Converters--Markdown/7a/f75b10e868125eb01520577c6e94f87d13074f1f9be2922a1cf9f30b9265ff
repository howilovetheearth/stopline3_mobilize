I"@<h2 id="covid-requirements">Covid Requirements</h2>
<p>For the safety of both you and those at the camp, please respect the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You need to present proof that, within 48 hours of joining any camp, you tested negative.
    <ul>
      <li>This is what indigenous leaders said. If you’re coming from thousands of miles away, this may be difficult, so we recommend:
        <ul>
          <li>Schedule your test so that you get your test results <em>before</em> you leave.</li>
          <li>Quarantine while you await those results.</li>
          <li>If you test negative, save the results and quarantine with the covid pod that will travel with you to Minnesota.</li>
          <li>Be prepared to show your results to those at the camp.</li>
          <li>It’s possible that indigenous members may ask you to exercise more caution, if they feel your covid precautions aren’t sufficiently
robust. Please be prepared to abide by any such request.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong><em>Please carry proof that you tested negative</em></strong>. Without proof, you cannot be admitted to any camp.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>At all times, you need to remain socially distanced from all others except those in your covid pod.</li>
  <li>Whenever in a camp, you need to be masked at all times.</li>
</ul>
