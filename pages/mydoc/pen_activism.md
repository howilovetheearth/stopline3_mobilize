Mail to the White House, 1600 Pennsylvania Ave. NW  Washington DC 20500 and tweet her at @Gina_McCarthy!
  
## Boycott and Divest
- Go online to Chase, Citi, Bank of America and others of the 18 lending banks  websites and post bad reviews telling folks what they are doing by funding Line 3 and asking customers to put pressure on these 18 banks to not renew the $2 billion credit facility renewal to Enbridge end of March.  If they don’t defund, we must divest.  If you have an account at one of these banks, move it to a community bank or credit union and tell them you will divest if they renew the loans and then follow through.  Wells Fargo, Citibank, and 64 other banks support these projects. See <a href="https://mazaskatalks.org/#theboycott" target="_blank"> this page</a> for more.
